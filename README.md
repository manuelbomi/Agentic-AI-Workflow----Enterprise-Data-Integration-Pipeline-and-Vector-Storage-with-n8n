# Agentic AI Workflow----Enterprise Data Integration Pipeline and Vector Storage with n8n

#### Introduction üìå
##### This repository demonstrates an Agentic AI workflow built with n8n that enables enterprises to:
    ‚Ä¢ Seamlessly ingest unstructured data from Google Drive
    ‚Ä¢ Preprocess and split documents into manageable chunks
    ‚Ä¢ Generate OpenAI embeddings
    ‚Ä¢ Store the resulting vectors in Pinecone for semantic search and downstream AI applications
    
##### By combining agentic AI patterns, n8n orchestration, and a scalable vector database architecture, this workflow forms a foundation for enterprise-grade AI systems such as:
    ‚Ä¢ Knowledge management platforms
    ‚Ä¢ AI-powered decision support systems
    ‚Ä¢ Intelligent document search and retrieval
    ‚Ä¢ Data-driven enterprise automation

The Agentic AI is shown in the figure below:

#### Workflow Overview  ‚öôÔ∏è 
##### The pipeline automates the following steps:

    1. Google Drive Trigger
        ‚ó¶ Watches a specified folder for newly created files.
        ‚ó¶ Automatically reacts when enterprise data is added.
        
    2. Download File
        ‚ó¶ Retrieves the uploaded file from Google Drive.
        
    3. Recursive Character Text Splitter
        ‚ó¶ Splits large documents into smaller, overlapping text chunks.
        ‚ó¶ Ensures context preservation for embeddings.
        
    4. Default Data Loader
        ‚ó¶ Prepares the document for AI processing.
        
    5. OpenAI Embeddings
        ‚ó¶ Transforms text chunks into vector embeddings.
        
    6. Pinecone Vector Store
        ‚ó¶ Inserts embeddings into a scalable vector database.
        ‚ó¶ Enables semantic search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and enterprise AI knowledge systems.
