# Agentic AI Workflow----Enterprise Data Integration Pipeline and Vector Storage with n8n

#### Introduction ðŸ“Œ
##### This repository demonstrates an Agentic AI workflow built with n8n that enables enterprises to:
    â€¢ Seamlessly ingest unstructured data from Google Drive
    â€¢ Preprocess and split documents into manageable chunks
    â€¢ Generate OpenAI embeddings
    â€¢ Store the resulting vectors in Pinecone for semantic search and downstream AI applications
    
##### By combining agentic AI patterns, n8n orchestration, and a scalable vector database architecture, this workflow forms a foundation for enterprise-grade AI systems such as:
    â€¢ Knowledge management platforms
    â€¢ AI-powered decision support systems
    â€¢ Intelligent document search and retrieval
    â€¢ Data-driven enterprise automation

The Agentic AI is shown in the figure below:
